# garden_sim

I wanted to make a text-based game! Seemed really cool. I'm trying to make a garden-simulator rougelike, with random encounters and a bunch of cool events!

Development Progress:
 - Foundations are set! Most core gameplay systems are online.
 - Really happy about my npc schedules - need to add more.
 - 

Future Steps:
 - I want to add more complex plant elements into the game, and perhaps crafting of seeds or items!
